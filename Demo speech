Introduction "Good morning everyone. Today, I am presenting 'AI Co-Teacher Pro'. In a class of 60 students, it is impossible for one teacher to know exactly who is confused and why. Students are often too shy to raise their hands. Our solution bridges this gap using AI."

Step 1: The Student Experience "Let's start with the Student View. Imagine I am a student studying late at night." [Click 'Student View' in Sidebar] "I have a doubt about Physics, but the teacher isn't available. So I ask my AI tutor." [Type: "I am confused about quantum physics"] "The AI gives me an instant, clear answer. But here is the magic—it didn't just answer me. It secretly recorded my confusion in the database."

Step 2: The Faculty Experience (Security) "Now, let's switch to the Professor's perspective." [Click 'Faculty View'] "You'll notice the dashboard is locked. This ensures student data remains private." [Enter Password: 1234]

Step 3: The Analytics Dashboard "Welcome to the Faculty Insights Dashboard.

Top Metrics: Instantly, the teacher sees the 'Primary Learning Gap'. The AI has analyzed all questions and detected that the class is struggling most with Science.

Gap Analysis Chart: This graph visually proves that Science questions (the blue bar) are higher than others."

Step 4: The Smart Features (Urgency & Filter) "But who specifically needs help? [Scroll down to Question Log] "Look at this table. The AI has automatically flagged the last student's query as 🔴 URGENT because they used words like 'confused'. [Click Filter Dropdown -> Select 'Science'] "I can also filter by subject. Before a Science class, I just select 'Science' to see exactly what students are asking about."

Conclusion "In summary, this isn't just a chatbot. It is an intelligent analytics tool that empowers teachers to stop guessing and start addressing real learning gaps. Thank you."
